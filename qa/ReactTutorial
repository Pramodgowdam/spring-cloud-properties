Differene between functional  and class comonent
functional												class comonent
no this and state									life cycle methods
its used for UI										High in functionality									
			


Differene between state and Props
props												state
Immutable										Its not immutable
props in state									this.props in state
this.props in stateless							useState hook in stateless
values passed from component			local to class, its managed within class
function parameters(it comes as 			Its local variable declared
argument to function)  	



State:	
	It should be declared only in constructor.
	values in state can be modified only using setState method
	it is asynchrnous function
	use callback options, if anything need to addressed based on value change in setState
	if we want to update the state, always use previous State because current state will not have the values of previousState
	multipleCalls to same function at same time, stategroups them together and perform one opetation like below
	 this.increment();
     this.increment();
     this.increment();	=		increment()
     this.increment();
     this.increment();


Event Binding
	{this.functionName.bind(this)}
	{() = > this.fimctionName()}
	{this.functionName}   // In constructor  this.functionName = this.functionName.bind(this)
	{this.functionName} // Instead function use arrow function.
	
Life Cycle in React(only for class component)

Mount
	constructor : its used for initializing state and binding the events. First line should be always super()
	statis getDerivedStateFromProps : When state of the component depends on changes in props over time. It is rarely used. this cant be used as it is static
	render Common used/ used for reading props and state. Majority of UI changes are recorded here.
	componentDidMount: its called only once when all the dom comonents are rendered
Update
	statis getDerivedStateFromProps: it decides whether component should rerender or not
	shouldComponentUpdate: It decides whether to update dom or not
	render
	getSnapShotBeforeUpdate:  it called before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM
	componentDidUpdate
Unmount
	componentWillUnmount
Error
	static getDerivedStateFromError
	componentDidCatch
	
Fragment
	Used to avoid additional div 

Pure component: it is similar to Regular Component. it implement shouldComponentUpdate method with shallow props and state comparison.  If there is change then it updates dom otherwise it wont 

Memo: Its equavilent to pure component but used for fuctional component 

ref: its used to create reference of dom element. It will be used to get the reference of element or component.
	 if it is not forward to childComponent then it will be called as component Reference. 

HOA: Its commonly used for reusable code where we will be defining the function which takes Original componet as argument then updates the necessary changes and return back.

props render: its another way of implementing the resuable code i.e. HOA

Context: Its the way of passing values from parent to child without repeating the value passing logic expliticitly. 
	We need to createContext which provide 2 method i.e provider and consumer.
	provider: Provides the value i.e where we can pass the value
	consumer: which helps in conuming the value and handling it over to childer
	its similar to singleton 

Hooks : it maily used to overcome the confusion of this, reduce lifecycle execution complexity  and reusable code i,e, HOA
